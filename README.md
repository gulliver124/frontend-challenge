# Frontend Developer Test

This should be a fairly simple task so don't spend more than one or two hours on it. I've provided a basic design [image](./design.png) that you should try and emulate.

The data will come from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ give me a list of Users to select from, select a user and then give me a list of their posts and albums

The icons used in the design are from https://feathericons.com/ but any icon pack can be used.

Email me if you have any questions.
